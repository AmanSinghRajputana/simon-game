# simon-game
This is a simple web-based game called Simon Game built using JavaScript, HTML, jQuery, and CSS. The game tests your memory skills by presenting a random pattern of colored boxes that you need to follow. If you make a mistake, the game restarts, and you have to try again.

How to Play
Open the Simon Game in your web browser.
The game starts with a single box lighting up, accompanied by a sound.
Repeat the pattern by clicking or tapping the corresponding boxes in the same order.
After each successful repetition, the game adds a new box to the pattern, making it progressively harder.
If you make a mistake by clicking the wrong box or taking too long to respond, the game ends, and you can restart to try again.
